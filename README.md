# The Crypto Looper

This is an abstracted database updater function for use on the [fomocryptocalculator.com](https://www.fomocryptocalculator.com) website. The CoinGecko rate limiting was causing problems so I made this function to grab missing closing prices for available cryptocurrencies and log them to a database.

It depends on Firebase private key environment variables inside `firebase-config.ts` so you won't be able to run it without generating your own.

## ðŸš€Setup locally

### 3. Run the compiled files

In a separate terminal window run the below command. This will watch for changes and rerun any functions in your terminal.
