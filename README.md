# The Crypto Looper

This is an abstracted database updater function for use on the [fomocryptocalculator.com](https://www.fomocryptocalculator.com) website. The CoinGecko rate limiting was causing problems so I made this function to grab missing closing prices for available cryptocurrencies and log them to a database.

It depends on Firebase private key environment variables inside `firebase-config.ts` and leverages Cloud Functions so it likely won't be of much use to you reading this.
